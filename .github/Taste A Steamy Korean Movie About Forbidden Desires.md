Taste is not a typical Korean movie that focuses on romance, comedy or action. It is a movie that delves into the dark and twisted side of human nature, where nothing is sacred and everything is for sale. The movie exposes the corruption and decadence of the wealthy elite, who use their money and power to manipulate and exploit others. The movie also shows the desperation and frustration of the lower class, who are willing to sacrifice their dignity and morality for a chance to escape their misery.
 
The movie does not shy away from showing the graphic and explicit scenes of sex and violence that occur between the characters. The movie does not judge or moralize, but rather lets the viewers decide for themselves what they think of the characters and their actions. The movie challenges the viewers to question their own values and preferences, and to confront their own hidden desires and fantasies.
 
Taste is a movie that will not appeal to everyone. It is a movie that will shock, disturb and offend some viewers, while it will intrigue, fascinate and arouse others. It is a movie that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it, whether it is positive or negative. It is a movie that will make you taste something different.
