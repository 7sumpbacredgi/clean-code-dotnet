Open-channel flow is the flow of water in a natural or artificial channel with a free surface. It is essential for the planning, design, and operation of water-resource projects, such as irrigation, drainage, flood control, hydropower, and navigation. Open-channel flow is also important for understanding natural phenomena, such as river morphology, sediment transport, and environmental hydraulics.

One of the most widely used textbooks on open-channel flow is *Open-Channel Flow* by M. Hanif Chaudhry, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of South Carolina. The second edition of this book was published in 2008 by Springer and has received positive reviews from students and instructors alike.
 
The book covers the basic concepts, conservation laws, critical flow, uniform flow, gradually varied flow, rapidly varied flow, channel design, special topics, unsteady flow, governing equations for one-dimensional flow, numerical methods, finite-difference methods, two-dimensional flow, and sediment transport. The book also includes numerous examples and real-life applications, as well as detailed coverage of unsteady flow and numerical methods.
 
The book is suitable for senior-level undergraduate and graduate courses on steady and unsteady open-channel flow. It is also a valuable reference for civil engineers who need up-to-date and relevant information on the latest developments and techniques in the field.
 
The book can be accessed online through SpringerLink or downloaded as a PDF file from various sources. However, readers are advised to purchase the hardcover or ebook version from Springer or other authorized sellers to support the author and publisher.
  
One of the main features of *Open-Channel Flow* by M. Hanif Chaudhry is the strong emphasis on the application of efficient solution techniques, computational procedures, and numerical methods suitable for computer analyses. The book provides several computer programs written in MATLAB and FORTRAN that can be used to solve various open-channel flow problems. The book also explains the theory and derivation of the numerical methods, such as the MacCormack scheme and the Preissmann scheme, and their advantages and limitations.
 
Another feature of *Open-Channel Flow* by M. Hanif Chaudhry is the inclusion of typical problems and exercises at the end of each chapter, as well as a solution manual for instructors. The problems and exercises are designed to test the understanding and application of the concepts and methods presented in the book. The solution manual provides detailed and step-by-step solutions to selected problems and exercises.
 
A third feature of *Open-Channel Flow* by M. Hanif Chaudhry is the comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the topics related to open-channel flow. The book covers both steady and unsteady flow techniques, as well as special topics such as channel design, water quality and water pollution, river regulation, channel restoration, and habitat creation. The book also incorporates the latest research findings and developments in the field of open-channel flow.
